# VitaliumVerb

A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) port of the reverb module from the [Vital](https://github.com/mtytel/vital)/[Vitalium](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/5c55f9445ee6ff75d53c7f8601fc341d200aa4a0/ports-juce6.0/vitalium) synthesizer. There are also some minor improvements and optimizations added.

This crate currently requires the nightly Rust toolchain since it uses the `portable_simd` feature.
