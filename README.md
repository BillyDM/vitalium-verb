# VitaliumVerb

A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) port of the reverb module from the [Vital](https://github.com/mtytel/vital)/[Vitalium] synthesizer, allowing it to be used as an effect plugin. There are also some minor improvements and optimizations added.

This plugin has no GUI yet, and I don't plan on making a GUI in the forseeable future. Although if anyone wants to contribute a GUI, I'd be happy to include it!

## Building

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and the [nightly toolchain](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html) (`rustup toolchain install nightly`), you can compile VitaliumVerb as follows:

```shell
cargo +nightly xtask bundle vitalium_verb --release
```

## Installing

Copy `/target/bundled/Vitalium Verb.clap` and/or `/target/bundled/Vitalium Verb.vst3` to the corresponding plugin directories for your OS.

On macOS you may need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) as Apple has recently made it more difficult to run unsigned code on macOS.
